# GovTech Internship Tech Test
Take-home assignment for SWE Career Coach (CC4.0)

## Challenge 1
For now, I have yet to make the bash script work.
However, you can run the code should work by following these steps:
1. Clone the repository using `git clone`.
2. Open the folder in your preferred IDE.
3. Run the `Main.java` file. The terminal will open up and await your inputs.
4. Proceed to copy any of the sample inputs from `~/src/bashscripting/inputs`.
5. Paste the input into the terminal and press `Enter`.
6. The results will be printed onto `System.out`.  
An example output for input file `sample5.in` would be: 
```
Number of transactions needed: 3
Transactions: [(Don -> Alice: $67.50), (Charlie -> Alice: $37.50), (Bob -> Alice: $7.50)]
```

### What is done so far
- Settled the main logic for the calculations
- Accepts input from `System.in` in CSV format
- Requires an additional `\n` newline input to terminate and return output of program

### What is yet to be completed
- [ ] Complete the bash script for auto-grading
- [ ] Add more unit testing
- [x] Complete the README instructions
